<h2><a name="WHY_PLANTS_TRAVEL" id="WHY_PLANTS_TRAVEL"></a>WHY PLANTS TRAVEL.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Plants</span> are great travelers; they often wander far
and wide. Sometimes they even cross the ocean and
take up their abode in a new land.</p>

<p>The oxeye daisy, our common meadow buttercup,
and the little Canada thistle, now so abundant everywhere,
are not native Americans, but came here from
Europe.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_005b.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="301" />
<p class="captioncenter">Buttercups.</p>
</div>

<p>Very likely they sailed in the ships with the early
settlers and took possession of the New World with
them. They are so much at home now
that most people think they always
grew here. But they did not,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>and when the Pilgrim Fathers looked over their new
home the fields were not white with daisies nor yellow
with buttercups.</p>

<p>No doubt the Pilgrim Fathers were glad of this, for
daisies and buttercups often cover the fields and spoil
the hay, and while “daisies in the meadow” seem very
lovely to the city people who go to the country for the
summer, daisies in the hay are another matter, and the
farmers do not think them lovely at all.</p>

<p>It is not the grown-up plants that travel, as a rule,
though some of them do. For you must know the
plant world is a topsy-turvy kind of place where the
parents stand still at home and the children wander
about.</p>

<p>Of course the children are the seeds, and they are
free, but when they once settle down and begin to
grow their wandering days are over.</p>

<p>Plants with roots are great home-bodies; nothing
short of actual violence can make them move from the
spot they have chosen. Frequently it happens that
they die if moved.</p>

<p>Not so with the seeds, however.</p>

<p>They wander about, and their parents often take
great pains to send them out into the world.</p>

<p>For the children of the plants are very apt to die if
they remain at home too long. They need to find a
place in which to settle down and grow, and it is often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>better for them to do this at a distance from their
parents.</p>

<p>Plants eat what is in the soil, and each kind of plant
needs some particular earth food. When plants of one
kind are crowded too closely in a place the earth is
often impoverished, and the plant might die out if it
were not able to find a fresh growing place. Then,
again, if the seeds always fell close to the parent plant,
the earth would soon become too crowded to support
more than a very few new plants.</p>

<p>So for these and other reasons it is best for the seeds
to go while they are able and find a place for themselves.</p>

<p>Nearly all seeds are provided with some way of moving
about, and while some of them go very short distances
others go very long ones.</p>

<p>They travel for their profit, and why may we not say
for their pleasure? For if a plant is able to feel and
enjoy at all,&mdash;and I for one believe it is,&mdash;then the
dandelion seeds must feel very joyous sailing before the
wind in the early summer, and later the thistle-down
and the milkweed seeds, scudding before the breeze.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everybody</span> is well acquainted with the dandelion,
but not everybody knows that it was brought
to this country from Europe. It is not probable
that a dandelion seed could come on the
wings of the wind three thousand miles across
the ocean, nor is it probable that people would
bring it on purpose.</p>

<p>Very likely dandelion seeds were accidentally
mixed in with the grass and clover seeds
the settlers brought from their homes in the
Old World.</p>

<p>Before the coming of the white man the Indian
did not see the roadsides yellow with dandelions,
nor did he see dandelions at all, excepting a kind
that grows sparingly way up north and another that
grows in the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>The European dandelions liked the
New World and when they had the
chance spread very fast, so that
now they are everywhere&mdash;at
least in
the East.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>
<p>The reason they were able to spread so is that the
dandelion seeds were able to fly.</p>

<p>If they had not flown away but had dropped down
close to the parent plant and grown there, they would
not have been allowed to spread much; for people do
not like dandelions in their fields and lawns, and try
hard to root them out.</p>

<p>This would be easy if the dandelions kept together
in patches. But they seem to say “catch me if you
can” as they fly on the wings of the wind, dropping
down here, there, and everywhere, striking root and
merrily growing.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="captioncenter">White-headed dandelions.</p>
</div>

<p>The parent dandelion takes very good care of its
seed children, and plans for their future success by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>giving each one a little plume by which it can be
blown about by the wind.</p>

<p>Everybody knows the pretty, fluffy, white-headed
dandelions that come after the yellow flowers.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_010.jpg" alt="" width="116" height="250" />
<p class="captioncenter">Seed case and plume<br />
magnified.</p>
</div>

<p>Children often blow on them “to see what time it
is.” If all the seeds fly away but one, they say it is
one o’clock; if two remain, they say it is two o’clock,
and so on.</p>

<p>They also blow on them to see if “mother
wants me,” as every child knows.</p>

<p>Each little silky part that flies away is a
seed case and its plume.</p>

<p>If you look carefully at the part of the
dandelion that flies about, you will see the
little brown seed case at one end, shaped
something like a tiny cucumber, and with
little teeth near its top.</p>

<p>Out of its top grows a silky white stalk, and at the
end of this is a tuft of soft little hairs by means of
which the seed case can float in the air.</p>

<p>Each dandelion seed case contains one little seed, but
the case fits the seed so closely that most people speak
of the whole thing&mdash;seed case and seed together&mdash;as
the seed. The proper name for such a seed case and
its seed is akene. <a name="fnanchor_A_A" id="fnanchor_A_A"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Not all akenes have plumes.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_A_A" id="Footnote_A_A"></a><a href="#fnanchor_A_A"><span class="label">[A]</span></a>
ȧ-kēn´</p></div>

<p>The top of the dandelion stem is a flat cushion, and
the little akenes, when the seeds are ripe, stand on it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>pointing out in different directions so there may be room
for every one with its spread-out
plume.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_011a.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="250" />
<p class="captioncenter">The flat cushion with<br />
a few seeds attached.</p>
</div>

<p>The plumes do not open out
until the seed is ready to be
blown away, and the akenes do
not stand pointing out in all directions
until the time to fly has
come. Before that they are all
packed closely together.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_011b.jpg" alt="" width="87" height="250" />
<p class="captioncenter">Before the plume<br />
opens out.</p>
</div>

<p>Because the little akene
is so light and feathery the breeze bears it
along, sometimes for quite a distance, but at
last it drops down to the earth or else is
blown among the grasses or weeds or stones
and lodges there, and when the right time
comes the seed that is in the little brown seed
case sprouts.</p>

<p>Sometimes the air seems to be full of
dandelion akenes floating about.</p>

<p>Although the dandelion is so bright and
pretty, people do not like it in their lawns.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_011c.jpg" alt="" width="75" height="250" />
<p class="captioncenter">All closely<br />
packed together.</p>
</div>

<p>Excepting when in bloom or when it is
“white-headed,” it is not as pretty as grass.
It does not make a beautiful velvety carpet
to the earth, but its leaves look ragged and
uneven and spoil the appearance of the lawn.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p>It is from its leaves that the dandelion gets its name,
for “dandelion” means “tooth of a lion”; and if you
look at a well-grown dandelion leaf you will understand
why it came to have such a fierce name.</p>

<p>Dandelions are very fond of growing in lawns.
They like to be taken care of, and they seem to like
to have their heads cut off.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_012.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="102" />
<p class="captioncenter">A well-grown dandelion leaf.</p>
</div>

<p>Anyway the lawn mower does not trouble them in
the least.</p>

<p>Their leaves grow close to the ground, in the shape
of a rosette, and when the lawn mower passes over,
only the large outer leaves are harmed; the young ones
towards the center of the rosette remain unhurt and
have more light and air and space to grow in; so our
dandelion flourishes in spite of its pruning.</p>

<p>When a dandelion once gets its roots started it does
not make so very much difference if it has its flowers
cut off, for it does not die when winter comes. Only
its leaves die. Its root continues alive in the earth,
and in the spring wakes up and puts out new leaves.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p>So cutting off the flowers does not destroy the dandelion,
it merely prevents seeds from forming, and more
dandelions from starting.</p>

<p>Dandelion roots kill the
grass by pushing it aside and
taking the earth-food for themselves.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_013.jpg" alt="bee on dandelion flower" width="300" height="213" />
</div>

<p>So if dandelions get started
in a lawn they will soon kill
out the grass, and then there will be a dandelion
lawn instead of a grass lawn!</p>

<p>A dandelion lawn is very beautiful for a little while
in the early summer. Sometimes it looks like a carpet
of gold, the yellow flowers are so thick and fine. But
when they are done blossoming the lawn is a sorry
looking sight.</p>

<p>Dandelions do not trouble the hay fields, for where
the grass is allowed to grow tall it soon smothers
them.</p>

<p>Boys are often hired to dig dandelion roots out of
lawns, and near large cities poor women may often be
seen digging them out for the sake of the young leaves
which, when they first come up in the spring, make
very good “greens.” These people sell them or eat
them instead of spinach. Tender young dandelion
leaves are very good indeed, and some people like
them better than spinach.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p>Dandelion plants have a wise way of protecting their
seed children until the time for flight.</p>

<p>The flower buds come out of the center of the leaf
rosette, close to the ground. They have very short
stems and seem to sit right on the
rosette.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_014a.jpg" alt="" width="227" height="350" />
<p class="captioncenter">1. A cluster of flowers.<br />
2. One flower (magnified).</p>
</div>

<p>There are a great many flowers in one dandelion head. Each little
yellow part of the dandelion flower head is a separate blossom, and
each separate blossom has one seed case with a seed inside growing to
the bottom of it.</p>

<p>All of these blossoms are shut up at first in a case of green,
leaf-like parts, and form the bud.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_014b.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="103" />
<p class="captioncenter">The bud.</p>
</div>

<p>As the bud grows older its stem lengthens a little, as you can see
in the picture on page 9&mdash;unless it is on a lawn. Then it does not
lengthen; it seems to know the lawn mower will come along and take off
its head if it grows taller, so it stays close to the ground. After a
while the green bud opens, the many little yellow flowers push their
way out, and the dandelion is in bloom.</p>

<p>Towards night the dandelion shuts up again; the
tiny yellow flowers press close together, and the outer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>covering of green bracts, as they are called, closes up,
too, and shuts them in all snug and safe.</p>

<p>When the dandelion has once closed it does not open again. But its
stem, which was very short, begins to lengthen.</p>

<p>It is a hollow stem, as you know, and has a bitter, milky juice.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_015.jpg" alt="dandelion" width="414" height="450" />
</div>


<p>Longer and longer grows the stem
with the closed-up flower cluster at its
top. But this wise stem does not
stand up. Oh, no, indeed! it lies
down or leans over, concealed by the
grass and weeds, unless it grows on a lawn. Then the
wise stem does not lengthen much; it is afraid of that
lawn mower.</p>

<p>If the dandelion is growing among tall grass, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>stem will grow very long indeed; if among short grass
it will not grow so long.</p>

<p>By this time you can guess why.</p>

<p>When the seeds are ripe and the silky plumes all nicely formed that
stem stands up!</p>

<p>It stands straight up and looks over the tops of the grasses. Then
the green bracts on the outside turn back, and the silky tufts spread
out and pull themselves free from the remains of the tiny flowers which
have withered and are no longer yellow. They do not fall off when the
flower first closes, but make a little cap to protect the growing
akenes, and when these get ready to open out the cap is pushed off by
them.</p>

<div class="figleft3"> <img src="images/i_016.jpg" alt="" width="250"
height="301" /> <p class="captioncenter">Opening out and pushing off
the cap.</p> </div>

<p>The hollow stem stands up, and its lovely silky head
of plumed akenes shines in the sunlight.</p>

<p>There is nothing much prettier in the plant world than
this head of fairy dandelion akenes all ready to fly away.</p>

<p>They stand and shine until a breeze comes along
that is strong enough to dislodge them, then all in a
moment they are off sailing through the air.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p>The parent plant is not sorry to have them go, for
this is what it has worked so hard to accomplish; and
as they float away, if it thinks at all, it no doubt
hopes that each little shining wanderer will alight at
last in a beautiful home of its own with plenty of space
and sunlight and food for its growth.</p>

<p>If there is not breeze enough to carry away the
dandelion akenes, when night approaches or a storm
gathers the careful parent plant does not allow these
silky treasures to become soaked and spoiled by
moisture.</p>

<p>Each little plume shuts up again! The silky tufts
no longer spread out, and the green bracts, too, turn up
and cover them safely as before. They go to sleep,
hoping, no doubt, for better luck next day.</p>

<p>There is no better fun than to watch the dandelions
do these things.</p>

<p>When children blow the heads of dandelions away,
that is just what the dandelions want, for it sets all
the akenes flying about in the air above the earth.</p>

<p>The main thing for a dandelion seed is to get started.
If it can get up in the air free from the weeds and
grasses, it will be sure to take quite a journey and will
doubtless settle in a new home.</p>

<p>The bitter milky juice of the dandelion very likely
protects it from being eaten by various plant-eating
creatures.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p>This juice is familiar to country children who pick
the long stems of the dandelions, split them, and
“curl” the parts in their mouths.</p>

<p>These pretty stems make very long and fine curls, as
every little country girl knows.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Nobody</span> can help liking
thistles&mdash;that is, to look at. We do not care to handle them, nor
do they care to have us, which perhaps is why they are covered all over
with such sharp prickles.</p>

<p>The prickles are an intimation to us to let them alone.</p>

<p>They do not want to be handled, and they do not want to be eaten.
When a plant arms itself with thorns or prickles, that is its way of
saying “hands off.” Few creatures besides donkeys eat
thistles.</p>

<p>It is said that donkeys are fond of them, and some
horses will nibble <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16"
id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>at them, but on the whole the thistles are
let alone, excepting by the farmer, who digs them up.</p>

<p>Thistles are much more troublesome than dandelions, for they get
into the hay and grain, and if let alone some kinds will kill out all
other plants and occupy the land themselves.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of thistles. Our large native ones that bear
beautiful showy purple, or pink, or white heads are not, as a rule,
very troublesome to the farmer.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_020.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="396" />
<p class="captioncenter">Canada thistle.</p>
</div>

<p>The little Canada thistle is the pest he dreads. That, like the
dandelion, came from Europe. No doubt its seeds were first brought
over&mdash;a very few of them&mdash;with other seeds from the Old
World. But all the little emigrant asked was to get started.</p>

<p>Once across the sea, it was able to conquer the plants
of America and get a place for itself, for its seeds fly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>like those of the dandelion, and in very much the
same way.</p>

<p>The Canada thistle spreads by running roots that
live through the winter, as well as by seeds, so no
wonder it quickly found its way far and wide.</p>

<p>It is for this reason sometimes called the creeping
thistle, and because it is so troublesome it is also
named the Cursed thistle.</p>

<p>There is a thistle in Europe which bears a light yellow
flower head and is called the Blessed thistle or the
Holy thistle. It has its name because people used to
believe it had power to counteract poison. This thistle
has been brought over from Europe, and is sometimes
to be found in the southern part of the United States,
where it has run wild.</p>

<p>Thistle heads are often very large and handsome.
Like the dandelion flower clusters, they are made up of
a large number of small blossoms.</p>

<p>Bees and blossoms are very fond of thistle honey,
and they can almost always be found on the blossoms,
sucking out the drop of honey which is to be found in
each little flower of the cluster.</p>

<p>At the bottom of each little flower, as in the dandelion,
is an akene. An akene, we remember, is a tight-fitting
seed case containing one seed. The thistle akene
also has a plume to fly with.</p>

<p>The thistle plume has no stalk, but grows right from <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>the top
of the akene. The plumed akenes are packed tightly away beneath the
scaly bracts that surround them.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_022a.jpg" alt="thistle seeds" width="250" height="159" />
</div>

<p>These bracts in the thistle are generally covered with sharp
prickles. So, although one likes to look at a thistle and inhale its
fragrance, it is not a pleasant flower to handle.</p>

<p>When the thistle seeds are
ripe, the prickly covering loosens,
and the akenes come trooping
out in a soft, fluffy mass.
Away they fly, one by one, as
the breeze dislodges them and
carries them off. They are
much more showy than the dandelion
akenes, for the plumes
are much larger.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_022b.jpg" alt="thistle" width="194" height="300" />
</div>

<p>Away they go, this way and
that, and after a while the
wind blows them against a
tree branch, or a fence rail, or
a stone. Then the akene thus stopped drops off from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>the plume to the ground. The akene, in this case, is
done sailing about. It has come to rest and very
likely will lie until the next spring before it sprouts.</p>

<p>The plume is not harmed at all when the akene
lets go, but at the next gust of wind flies on, lighter
than ever.</p>

<p>One often sees these seedless plumes sailing about in
the summer and fall.</p>

<p>People sometimes gather the heads of large thistles
before the seeds are ripe, pull out the pink part of the
flowers, carefully pull off the prickly bracts, and hang
the rest up to dry. The akenes do not then fall off,
but the plumy part fluffs out and makes a pretty pompon
with which the children’s hats can be trimmed.</p>

<h3><a name="MILKWEEDS" id="MILKWEEDS"></a>MILKWEEDS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Most</span> of us like milkweeds. They are not
so troublesome as the dandelions and thistles. They generally grow
in waste places, along stone walls, or outside fences, where they do
no harm to the crops but make the roadsides charming. Most kinds of
milkweeds have a milky juice, as their name tells. It is thicker and
stickier than the dandelion juice, and is very disagreeable if one gets
it on his fingers.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_024.jpg" alt="milkweed" width="178" height="350" />
</div>

<p>This, no doubt, is why the plant makes it that way. It does
not wish us to get its juice on our fingers; it wishes us to let
it alone. It also wishes animals to let it alone and not eat it;
and most animals are not fond of it. This is not true, however, of
certain caterpillars.</p> <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21"
id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p> <p>Towards fall you will generally see
the milkweed leaves covered with bright yellow and black caterpillars
that certainly are lovely whether you think, so or not.</p>

<p>If you take the largest of these caterpillars and put them in a box
of earth with plenty of fresh milkweed leaves to eat as long as they
want to eat (which will not be long), you will see what happens.</p>

<p>Something happens, and you will do well to find out about it.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_025.jpg" alt="milkweed flower" width="173" height="350" />
</div>

<p>Milkweeds have pretty, fragrant flowers that grow together, many
in a bunch, but not close together into a solid head, like the little
dandelion flowers. Each milkweed flower has its own little stem.</p>

<p>Not all of the flowers in a bunch of milkweed go to seed. Generally
only one or two from each bunch do. The rest are crowded out and wither
and fall off, for the milkweed flower develops a very large seed pod
that holds a great many seeds, and there is not room on the stem for
many of these big pods.</p>

<p>The flowers of our common milkweed are pink-purple
in color, and the pods are fuzzy and irregular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>on the outside, and are shaped as you see in the
picture.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_026.jpg" alt="milkweed pod" width="148" height="250" />
</div>

<p>Inside they are lovely. The pod itself is as smooth
and shiny as satin, and there is a bridge running lengthwise;
to this grow the seeds&mdash;a great
many in each pod. Each seed has a
plume and looks very much like the
thistle akene with its plume. But
these seeds have no seed case, excepting
the large pod in which they all lie
together. They grow inside this case,
which opens to let them escape. The
milkweed seed looks so much like the
thistle akene that you would have to
examine it very carefully to discover the difference.</p>

<p>The milkweed seeds are brown and round and flat,
and each has a silky plume, with no stalk to the
plume. The seeds lie packed closely together in the
pod with their plumes unopened, but when they are
ripe the pod splits open down one side and the plumes
fluff out.</p>

<div class="figright2">
<img src="images/i_027.jpg" alt="milkweed seeds" width="250" height="219" />
</div>

<p>Then you will see a pretty sight. From the gap in the
pod the pretty, silky seeds come spilling out. Their
plumes touch each other and hold the seeds together in
a soft feathery mass until along comes the breeze.
Then one after another the pretty seeds float away
and the empty pods are left behind.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<p>Sometimes children catch bees in empty milkweed
pods. The bees make a great buzzing in the pod, and it
is not fair to keep them long, for it interferes with their
honey-gathering or pollen-collecting. If there is anything
a bee hates, it is to waste time, with so many
hungry mouths at home waiting to be fed.</p>

<p>Like the thistles, when the milkweed seeds become
quite dry they often drop away from their plumes, particularly
if they strike against something when sailing
about.</p>

<p>There are a number of species of milkweeds. One
common species has bright, orange flowers, and is called
butterfly weed. Its flowers look a little like bright
butterflies, and the butterflies are fond of its honey.</p>

<p>There is a lovely milkweed in Florida that has large
pea-green leaves with broad pink veins running all
through them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>Some species of milkweeds have long, slender, smooth
pods, and very likely you have noticed them along the
roadside.</p>

<h3><a name="LETTUCE" id="LETTUCE"></a>LETTUCE.</h3>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_029.jpg" alt="garden lettuce gone to seed" width="129" height="380" />
<p class="captioncenter">Garden lettuce gone<br />

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> who have seen lettuce only on the
table, or growing in the early spring garden or in the green-house,
will feel like laughing at the idea of lettuces flying!</p>

<p>Yet they do fly. At least their seeds do.</p>

<p>Sometimes lettuces look like rosettes growing out of the ground,
and sometimes they look like little cabbages. But that is only the
leaves.</p>

<p>If lettuces are let alone and not picked, in time they will “go
to seed”; a stalk will grow up from the middle, with small leaves on
it and a great many little flower heads that look somewhat like tiny
dandelions.</p>

<p>These flower heads are made like those of the dandelion or
thistle.</p>

<p>The lettuce has no prickles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>but its juice is milky and bitter, and gets more bitter
as the plant grows older. The lettuce flowers have
akenes like the dandelion, and each akene has a plume
like that of the dandelion.</p>

<p>Away fly the pretty plumed akenes, and lettuce is thus sown by the
wayside. But one seldom sees garden lettuce growing, except in gardens;
for it is so tender the strong, rough weeds choke and kill it.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_030.jpg" alt="wild lettuce" width="121" height="280" />
<p class="captioncenter"> Wild lettuce.</p>

<p>There is a wild lettuce, however,
that has a large number of flower
heads, and of course a great many
pretty, silky, tufted akenes. These lettuces
sometimes shine as if they had
been snowed upon when their silky,
white plumed akenes first open out.</p>

<p>I advise you to see if you can find
some of them next summer. The best place to look
is alongside fences and hedges and in the corners of
pastures.</p>

<p>There is a lettuce so troublesome to the farmer that
large sums of money have been appropriated to exterminate
it. It is called the Prickly Lettuce, because its
leaves and stalks are prickly. It came to this country
from Europe. It is quite as destructive to the farmer’s
crops as is the Canada thistle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> course the clematis akenes fly.
Nothing so fluffy as they, in the seed world, could
do otherwise.</p>

<p>The wild clematis that grows over the bushes in some
swamps is a beautiful vine with glossy leaves and clusters
of pretty white flowers. After the snowy flowers
have gone it is still beautiful, for then each little akene
waves a long, shining, curly plume. The whole vine is
covered with these shining, twining plumes.</p>

<p>But a day comes when they no longer shine. Each
curling plume looks like a mass of down, for its parts
have separated and stand out, and we now see that it
is shaped like a feather, a downy fluffy feather. The
whole vine is a soft fluffy mass.</p>

<p>This does not last long, for the akenes leave the parent vine and
are borne aloft on their airy plumes by the wind that scatters them far
and wide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Asters</span> and golden-rod blossom in the fall. Then the
country roads are lovely to walk over, and the fields
are as bright as can be with blue
or purple or white asters and yellow
golden-rod.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_033.jpg" alt="" width="174" height="420" />
<p class="captioncenter"> Asters.</p>
</div>

<p>Some kinds of golden-rod and
asters blossom in the summer, but
most of them wait until late in the
season. They are almost the last
flowers to come and almost the last
to go.</p>

<p>When their bright flowers fade
they are still pretty. Each “flower”
of the asters is like the dandelion,
a cluster of very small flowers, and
the golden-rod flower head is made
up of very many tiny flowers.</p>

<p>Each little flower has its own
akene and plume quite like the
dandelion, but a great deal smaller, and in time the
clusters that were flowers become clusters of soft
downy plumes.</p>

<p>This state does not last long, for the akenes are blown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>away by the wind and sown far and near over field and
roadside.</p>

<p>If you brush against the downy aster and golden-rod
heads when the seeds are ripe, the akenes will cling to
your clothes like cobwebs and you will carry them
about with you until finally they fall off.</p>

<p>Perhaps that is one way by which the golden-rod and
aster seeds travel about; they cling to animals that pass
and so are carried far away. But they do not cling as
well as some other seeds we are soon to know about.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_035a.jpg" alt="" width="129" height="400" />
<p class="captioncenter"> Pussy willow.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> willow that children know and love the best is
the pussy willow. It grows in damp or swampy places
and before the leaves come out
in the spring the “pussies” are
seen on the branches. They
are little, soft, silvery pussies,
and it is not everybody who
knows what they really are.</p>

<div class="figright1b">
<img src="images/i_035b.jpg" alt="catkin" width="91" height="300" />
</div>

<p>Each “pussy” or catkin, as
we must call it, is a group of small
flowers, or rather flower-buds, for after
the flowers are fully out the pussies
lose their soft, silky appearance and
no longer deserve to be called pussies.</p>

<p>The older catkins are covered with stamens
full of yellow pollen or
else with seed pods. For willows
bear two kinds of flowers,
the stamen-bearing, or staminate
flowers, and the seed-bearing,
or pistillate flowers.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_035c.jpg" alt="" width="208" height="280" />
<p class="captioncenter">Staminate catkin<br />
fully out.</p>
</div>

<p>The staminate flowers grow on one willow tree, and
the pistillate ones on another.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<p>The pollen in the staminate flowers is very abundant
and is carried by the wind or by insects to the pistillate
flowers. If you shake a twig of ripe
staminate catkins, your hands and
clothes will be covered with pollen
dust.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_036.jpg" alt="" width="130" height="120" />
<p class="captioncenter">Pistillate<br />
catkin.</p>
</div>

<p>Bees are fond of willow pollen and
eagerly gather it in the early spring. The willow
catkin has a tiny drop of nectar at the base of each
little flower, and bees and flies are fond of this and
visit the willows to get it. Of course, as the insects
fly from one catkin to another, they carry pollen from
one to another.</p>

<p>After a time the staminate flowers wither and fall,
but the pistillate ones are followed by seed pods, and
the stem that bears them lengthens to make room for the
growing pods, and at last when the seeds are ripe the
pods split open and out come the <em>tiniest</em> of little seeds,
each with a tiny plume of down, and away they fly.</p>

<p>There are a great many species of willow, and not all
of them are as pretty as the pussy willow. One reason
why the pussy willow is so pretty is that the catkins
appear before the leaves. In some willows the catkins
come with the leaves, and in some they come after the
leaves are fully grown. Many willows have bright red
or yellow or green stems that give color to the landscape
even in midwinter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<p>In all willows the pistillate catkins bear pods that
open and let out fluffy seeds.</p>

</div>

<p>The cotton-wood trees are relatives of the willows.
Their seeds are so very downy that
when they are ripe the ground beneath
the trees will often be white,
as though a light snow had fallen.</p>

<p>It is because the seeds are so
abundantly supplied with soft cottony
plumes that the tree is called
cotton-wood.</p>

<p>Poplars are also closely related to the willows and,
like them, have fluffy seeds.</p>

<p>In the early summer, if you look in the right place,
you will see plenty of them.</p>

<p>Willow and poplar twigs are very strong and limber,
and some kinds are used to make baskets and chairs
and cradles and a great many other useful things.
The slender young twigs are woven together and make
very strong and durable articles.</p>

<p>Since only the long twigs can be used, people get
them in large quantities by cutting off the heads of the
trees, when long sprouts shoot up all around the ends
of the cut limbs. Cutting off the tops of the trees in
this way is called pollarding, and a pollarded willow or
poplar is rather a funny sight, particularly after it has
had its head cut off a number of times.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_038a.jpg" alt="" width="659" height="350" />
<p class="captioncenter">Pollarded willows.</p>
</div>

<p>Willow branches about as large around as one’s finger
make very good whistles in the spring of the year.
The sap flowing under the bark loosens it, so that by
pounding the twig the bark can be slipped off unbroken,
the wood beneath cut as desired, and the bark slipped
on again.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_038b.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="38" />
</div>

<p>The dotted lines show how
the wood should be cut away under the bark.</p>

<p>Willow twigs also make very good switches, and
long, ah, very long ago, when children used to be
naughty, willow switches were in great demand.</p>

<p>In these later days children are never naughty I
suppose&mdash;or is it only that switching has gone out of
fashion?</p>

<p>These switches did not come from weeping willows,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>though that certainly would have been a very appropriate
name for them.</p>

<p>Weeping willows are large and beautiful trees that
came from the eastern part of Asia. The twigs are
very long and slender and hang down like a veil all
about the tree.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_039.jpg" alt="weeping willow" width="350" height="243" />
</div>

<p>Weeping willows are favorites in parks and pleasure
grounds, and it used to be the fashion to plant them in
cemeteries, at the heads of gravestones.</p>

<p>Everybody who has tried to preserve bird skins, or
the skins of small animals, doubtless knows what salicylic
acid is, but not everybody knows that this is
obtained from the bark of willows and poplars. Some
species of willow contain a great deal of the substance
from which salicylic acid is made.</p>

<p>Salicylic acid prevents animal tissue from decaying,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>and it is also used as a medicine. It is not poisonous,
but is rather unpleasant to handle, as it is apt to make
one sneeze.</p>

<p>The bark of willows is also used in Europe for tanning,
instead of oak or hemlock bark, which is commonly
used in this country.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_040.jpg" alt="willow twig" width="253" height="400" />
</div>

<p>“Tan bark” is bark that has been ground up and
had the “tannin,” or substance that hardens leather,
extracted from it. The tan bark is then put on roads
or walks, or sometimes on city streets, to deaden the
noise. It is often used in the country for
banking up houses in the winter.</p>

<p>Willows grow quickly, and some of those that like wet places are
often planted on sandy shores of lakes or streams, or on banks, that
their roots may bind the sand or loose earth together and so keep the
shore from shifting.</p>

<p>Very often a willow twig can be made to grow by merely sticking the
cut end in damp earth, and many a large willow has thus been planted as
a twig by the hand of a little child.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Cattail</span> seeds fly, too! It is surprising
to know that cattails blossom. But they do.</p>

<p>In the early spring, cattails look green instead of brown, and the
thickened green part near the top is made of very, very small flowers
packed tightly together.</p>

<p>The brown velvety part of the cattail succeeds the green flowers,
and is but a collection of tiny seed pods that fluff out with tiny
plumes in the autumn.</p>

<p>There are two kinds
of flowers in cattails, as there are in
willows, only in the cattails the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>kinds are on the same plant. If you look at a cattail
in its green stage, you will easily find the staminate
flowers growing at the very top of the stalk,&mdash;at
<em>A</em> in the picture. Out of these staminate flowers
you can shake clouds of yellow pollen. Below the
staminate flowers at <em>B</em> are the pistillate flowers,
very small and packed very closely together.
Each one has a seed pod at its base, and each
seed pod when ripe has a tiny plume.</p>

<p class="captioncenter">Cattails with ripe<br />

</div>

<p>Of course the seed pods fly away on the wings
of the wind. Being so small and light, they are
sometimes carried a long distance.</p>

<p>A good many, no doubt, are so unfortunate as to fall
on dry ground, and that
is the end of them.</p>

<p>But others fall in
swamps and ditches,
where they grow vigorously
and often fill up
the swamp or the ditch
so that it becomes a bed
of cattails.</p>

<p>The downy cattail seeds are gathered in some places and made into
mattresses for people to sleep on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> bright flowers raised in hothouses or
in windows, and that we call geraniums, do not often bear seed in the
house.</p>

<p>In that part of the world where they grow wild, and out of doors in
the summer time, they do. And their seeds are very curious indeed; for
they can not only fly about but can bury themselves in the ground.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_043a.jpg" alt="geranium seed pod" width="32" height="130" />
</div>

<p>The geranium flower bears five curious seed pods that grow close
together around a common center. Each seed pod has one seed, and when
the seed is ripe the pod splits away from the center-piece. The pod
runs up to a point, as you can see in the picture.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_044a.jpg" alt="feather-like plume" width="64" height="130" />
</div>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_044b.jpg" alt="" width="121" height="130" />
</div>

<p>There is a long feather-like plume packed in the long <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>stem-like
part of the pod, and this comes out when the pod splits away. Then the
whole thing is floated off by the wind. This curious plume curls up
like a corkscrew when dry, and so pushes the seed down into the grass
or the earth where it has fallen. When the plume is made damp by rain
or dew it straightens out.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_044c.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="59" />
</div>

<p>At the bottom of the seed case are a few hairs or bristles that
point backward and hold the seed so that it cannot be pulled out of the
ground when the plume curls and straightens, but must always be pushed
farther in.</p>

<p>It is a good plan for every one who has not seen the geranium seed
case try to plant itself, to gather some ripe seeds and lay them on
the earth in a flower pot. Let them get dry, then moisten them, then
let them become dry again, and so on, until one has seen just how they
work.</p>

<h3><a name="COTTON" id="COTTON"></a>COTTON.</h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Down South</span>” are a great many cotton fields.
Cotton was brought to the United States from China
and other far-away places. It did not find its way here
accidentally with other
seeds, like the dandelions
and Canada thistles, but
was brought on purpose
and carefully cultivated.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_045.jpg" alt="" width="239" height="320" />
<p class="captioncenter">Ripe cotton bolls.</p>
</div>

<p>A cotton field in early summer is rather a pretty sight. It is
covered with light green little plants in straight rows; they have
pretty leaves and yellowish flowers that soon turn red. These flowers
are about the size of a morning-glory.</p>

<p>In the fall a cotton field is much more interesting.
Then the cotton plants are three or four feet high and
have branched out into quite large bushes. The leaves
have withered, but the bushes are covered with cotton
bolls, or pods, out of which are bursting quantities of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>snowy white cotton. The field looks as if a skyful of
soft little snowballs had fallen upon it.</p>

<p>The cotton flowers are succeeded by pods, or bolls as they are
called, and these contain black seeds about the size of a white bean.
Each seed when ripe wears a coat of long, soft, white cotton fibers,
and when the bolls split open to let out the seeds, out gush streams of
snowy cotton.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_046a.jpg" alt="" width="123" height="140" />
<p class="captioncenter"> An unopened boll.<br />

</div>

<p>A cotton field is most picturesque during the picking season, when
the negroes, the women with bright kerchiefs over their heads, go into
the fields, pick the cotton, and carry it away in large baskets.</p>

<div class="figright">

<p class="captioncenter">A boll just opened.<br />

(½ nat. size.)</p>
</div>

<p>Each cotton seed is covered with cotton fiber that clings very
close and has to be removed by machinery. The machine that does this
is called a cotton gin, and is a very interesting and wonderful
machine.</p>

<div class="figleft">

</div>

<p>Cotton seeds are cleaned more than once; the first time the long
fibers are pulled off, and this is the best of the cotton. Then
the seeds are cleaned <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43"
id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>again of less valuable, because shorter,
fibers, and finally of the short fuzzy coat that clings to them after
the second cleaning. The result of the last cleaning is a very inferior
cotton, used only for a few kinds of cheap cloth.</p>

<p>Not all cotton has white fiber. The Nankin cotton,
which is grown near the mouth of the Mississippi River
in this country, is naturally of a light tan color.</p>

<p>Cotton is one of the most useful plants in the world,
and a great deal of attention is given to raising and
manufacturing it.</p>

<p>The cotton has to go through a good many processes
before it is finally ready to be spun into thread and
then woven into cloth.</p>

<p>Some very useful cotton is not spun into thread, but
comes to us in clean, soft rolls, which we call cotton
batting. This is useful for many household purposes,
and when very thoroughly cleaned is used by doctors
in dressing wounds.</p>

<p>A large part of our clothing is made from the cotton
that grows on the seeds of the cotton plant. The plant
did not make the cotton for us, but probably to enable
its seeds to be carried away by the wind and firmly
fastened to the ground, when they lodged there. For
a cotton seed clings very tightly to the earth, particularly
after it has been wet.</p>

<p>Cotton seeds are very useful aside from the cotton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>they are clothed with. They contain a good deal of oil
and are ground in mills, that the oil may be pressed
out. This oil is put to a number of uses, and when
purified is even used instead of olive oil as food. The
meal that is left after the oil has been pressed out
makes a valuable fertilizer, and is also used as food for
cattle. Horses will not eat it, but cows are so fond of
it that they will come long distances to the mills in
order to lick up what meal they can find. This is the
way its value as a food for cattle was discovered.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_048.jpg" alt="cotton" width="240" height="215" />
</div>

<p>Cotton-seed meal is bright greenish yellow in color,
and as it colors everything it touches, the cotton-seed
mills are rather picturesque to look at, though not very
pleasant to walk about in.</p>

<p>The bark of the root of the cotton plant is used as a medicine. But
though so many parts of this wonderful plant are useful, the cotton
that covers the seeds is the most valuable of all.</p>

<p>The wings are thin and light, and the wind sometimes carries them
a long distance. The maple blooms in the spring or early summer, and
though its flowers have only stamens or pistils and no bright petals,
yet they are very pretty.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_051a.jpg" alt="" width="208" height="300" />
</div>

<p>Maples, like willows and cattails, often have two kinds of flowers.
One maple tree will often have all staminate flowers, and will look as
if trimmed with fringe, as the staminate flowers have slender stems
like threads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_052.jpg" alt="pistillated maple flowers" width="167" height="300" />
</div>

<p>The red maple, which blooms early in the spring before its leaves
come out, has bright red fringes. Sometimes these red-flowered trees
bloom in January, in Florida, when the trees and bushes around them are
bare, and you can imagine they make the swamps where they grow look
very bright.</p>

<p>The pistillate flowers are not quite as airy as the staminate ones,
but still they make pretty fringes upon the trees.</p>

<p>The wind blows the pollen from the staminate flowers to the
pistillate ones growing on neighboring trees, and that is why the
flowers hang out on long stems.</p>

<p>Some maples have green fringes and some have yellow
ones, but all are beautiful.</p>

<p>After the flowering season is over, the staminate
flowers disappear. But the pistillate flowers are followed
by clusters of samaras, which are sometimes
almost as bright in color and as pretty as the flower
fringes.</p>

<p>When the samaras are ripe, they fall from the tree
and are blown about by the wind. They cannot fly as
far as the plumed seeds, but they sometimes get carried
quite a distance.</p>

<p>The seed within the samara often sprouts soon after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>it falls. You can see little maple trees starting to grow
by the roadside, or even along city sidewalks or in lawns.</p>

<p>The samaras of the early flowering maple trees fall quite early in
the summer, but there are other maples whose samaras remain on the
trees until autumn.</p>

<p>Maples make beautiful shade trees, and some species grow to a large
size. One of the largest and most beautiful of them is the sugar maple,
which is not only valuable as a shade tree, but yields delicious maple
syrup from its sap.</p>

<div class="figleft2">
<img src="images/i_053.jpg" alt="bark of tree being tapped" width="134" height="230" />
</div>

<div class="figleft3">
<img src="images/i_053a.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="124" />
</div>

<p>The bark of this tree is “tapped,”
that is, a hole is bored through it into
the wood beneath, early in the spring,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>and a little wooden tube or trough is driven into the
hole. A pail is hung or set beneath to catch the sap
as it runs out. Sap runs best when the days are warm
and the nights cold; then there are merry times in the
sugar camps.</p>

<p>The sap is collected in large kettles and boiled to
syrup, or until it hardens into sugar. Just before it
is ready to turn to sugar, it makes delicious “wax.”
You pour the hot, thick syrup upon snow, and when it
thickens into a sticky paste you eat it. It is better
than any kind of candy&mdash;at least I think so.</p>

<p>A great deal of sugar is made in the New England
States, where the maple grows abundantly, and in the
early days the only sugar some of the people had was
maple sugar.</p>

<p>Sometimes the sap of other trees, as birches or elms,
is made into syrup, but none is as abundant or as good
as the maple syrup.</p>

<p>The wood of the sugar maple is hard and is valuable
for furniture and other uses. Indeed the wood of most
of the maples is prized for furniture making.</p>

<p>The bird’s eye maple is a very pretty satiny wood
dotted over with round spots that look a little like eyes.
It comes from certain sugar maples whose wood is full
of little knotty places.</p>

<p>The curled maple is also a pretty wood with wavy,
shining lines made by irregular streaks in the wood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>It is sometimes found in sugar maples and sometimes
in other maples. Maple wood is light in color, and the
bark of the tree is rather smooth. It is gray in most
species, and often has white spots on it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> American elm is one of the most beautiful trees
in the world, it is so majestic in size and so graceful in
form.</p>

<p>If you do not know the elm tree, get some one to point it out to
you at once, and you will feel that you have made a new friend. It is
a very good thing to make friends with the trees and to learn to know
them when you see them.</p>

<p>Elm trees have winged seed pods or samaras. The trees are covered
with pretty, short fringes in the springtime&mdash;very pretty, but not
as airy and pretty as the maple fringes. The pistillate flowers are
followed by samaras that do not grow two together, and that have the
wing growing around them instead of from one end.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_056b.jpg" alt="elm winged seed pods" width="220" height="233" />
</div>

<p>The bark of the elm is very handsome;
it is marked quite regularly and is easy to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>recognize. It is a good thing to learn to know a tree
by its bark. The bark of trees is an interesting and
beautiful subject for study.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_057.jpg" alt="elm tree trunk" width="161" height="250" />
</div>

<p>The wood of the elm is tough and hard, and is used in building ships
and making wheels, and for other purposes where a tough, hard wood is
required.</p>

<p>There are a number of species of elm trees,
but the best-known one is the beautiful
American elm that is everywhere used in
parks and for shade trees. Next to this is
the red elm, or slippery elm, whose inner bark
is fragrant and mucilaginous and good to
chew. This bark is good for colds and is
sometimes ground up and made into lozenges.</p>

<p>Every country boy lays up a supply of
slippery elm bark to dry in the attic along
with his nuts.</p>

<h3><a name="ASH_TREES" id="ASH_TREES"></a>ASH TREES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Ash</span> trees are tall, straight, and handsome, with a
very dark-colored bark, so regularly marked that one
soon learns to know it at a glance. I once knew three
of them that stood in an open pasture on the shore of
Lake Ontario.</p>

<p>It was worth going to the pasture in a high wind to
see the tall, beautiful trunks sway as the wind struck
them. I used to wish I could climb up into the tops of
them, though it would have been a very unsafe perch
indeed.</p>

<p>You have guessed by now that ash trees have winged
seed pods, and so they have.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_058.jpg" alt="leaves of the ash" width="400" height="191" />
</div>

<p>When the little clusters of ash flowers first show
in the springtime they are black, and the tree seems
to have black-tipped branches. Soon the black tips
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>develop into dark green fringes, though these are not
airy and light, like the maple and elm fringes.</p>

<p>The best way for you to find out just how ash blossoms
look is&mdash;but you know perfectly well what is
the very best way to find out, and I hope you will
take care to do it.</p>

<p>Ash seeds are winged like those of the maples and
are called samaras, but they do not grow two together.
Ash trees often bear great numbers of samaras, more
than any other tree. Where ash trees grow near houses,
the samaras often fall on the roofs and fill up the
gutters, so that they have to be cleaned out, sometimes
more than once in a season.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_059.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="206" />
<p class="captioncenter">Ash samaras.</p>
</div>

<p>The wood of the ash is so very tough and elastic that from all time
it has been used to make bows and spear shafts. Of course it is also
valuable for less warlike uses.</p>

<p>When you read the “One Hoss Shay,” you will find
one use to which ash wood is sometimes put.</p>

<p>The ash tree used to be held sacred by the ancient
Norsemen, and some day you will read beautiful stories
about the wonderful ash Ygdrasil.</p>

<p>The small tree we call “mountain ash” is not an
ash at all, and it has, as you know, red berries instead
of samaras.</p>

<h3><a name="PINES" id="PINES"></a>PINES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Pine</span> trees bear cones, and cones do not
fly. But if you examine the scales of the cones, you will find a winged
seed under each. When the cones are ripe the scales open and the seeds
drop out and are caught by the wind and floated away.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_060a.jpg" alt="pine cone" width="350" height="237" />

</div>

<p>There are a great many species of pine trees. The seeds of some are
large and sweet and are sold as pine nuts. These trees do not grow in
this country, however, and we should have to go to South America, or to
Asia, or western Europe to find pine trees from which we could gather
nuts.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_060b.jpg" alt="pine seeds" width="185" height="250" />
</div>

<p>Squirrels gather nuts from all the pine trees, however, for they
are not as particular as we, and think them all good. They are very
clever at gathering cones, gnawing off the scales and getting out the
seeds.</p>

<p>Pine trees, like the maples and elms, have two kinds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>of&mdash;not exactly flowers, but something answering to
them. The ovules, or young seeds, are borne under the
scales of the cones, and the stamens are in catkins.
Sometimes these catkins are very large, and they bear a
great deal of pollen which the wind carries to the cones.</p>

<p>A pine forest is always a sweet and delightful place.
When the sun shines on the trees they fill the air with
fragrance.</p>

<p>Pine trees used to grow all over the northern part of
the United States, but they make very valuable timber,
and so have been carelessly cut down and the forests
destroyed, until now in many places there are almost
no pine trees left.</p>

<p>This was a great mistake, as the people now know.
The white pine of the North gave a soft white wood that
could be easily carved or “turned,” and it was used more
extensively than any other wood as long as the forests
lasted.</p>

<p>A large part of the South is still covered by forests
of yellow pine, whose wood is dark, hard, and valuable
for building purposes.</p>

<p>The pine forests of the South also yield large quantities
of tar, resin, and turpentine, and it is sad to see the
forests being carelessly destroyed each year. The trees
are cut for their sap, from which turpentine and other
products are made, but if the same trees are cut three
years in succession they die.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>
<p>The turpentine makers, however, cut them as long as
they will yield sap, because it is easier to stay in one
place three years than to move their camps to a region
of fresh trees. This is wrong, and will result in destroying
the valuable Southern pine forests in a short time.</p>

<p>We should take care of the trees, for they are our
good friends. Besides providing wood for all sorts of
uses, they protect the earth, keep it moist, and prevent
the streams from drying up. In many places the farming
land has been destroyed, because the forests were
cut down when the land all about dried up, so that nothing
of value to man could grow on it.</p>

<p>With proper management trees can be cut for use
without destroying the forests.</p>

<h2><a name="SEEDS_THAT_FLY_WITHOUT_WINGS" id="SEEDS_THAT_FLY_WITHOUT_WINGS"></a>SEEDS THAT FLY WITHOUT WINGS
OR PLUMES.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Poppy</span> seeds have no wings and no plumes, and yet
they are carried far and wide by the wind.
That is because they are so very small and so
very light. They look more like dust than
seeds.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_063b.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="396" />
<p class="captioncenter">Poppy pod.</p>
</div>

<p>The poppy pod is like a cup with a cover on, but around the edge,
just below the cover, is a row of small holes, each covered by a lid.
These lids do not open until the poppy seeds are ripe; then they do,
and the fine seeds can get out of the holes. But <em>how</em> do they get out?
They cannot move of themselves, but the wind sways the poppy pod this
way and that on its long stalk, and the little seeds are shaken out
only to be caught by the wind and blown away.</p>

<p>Perhaps you think that is not a very sure way for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>the seeds to escape, but if you examine a poppy head
that has been ripe for some time you will find scarcely a
seed in it, so it proves to be a better way than it looks.</p>

<p>Nature’s way is generally the best way to accomplish
an object.</p>

<p>Poppies are often seen growing by the roadside or
in the garden, far from the flower beds; that is because
the wind has blown the seeds to these places.</p>

<p>In England the wheat fields are often gay with scarlet
poppies, which have, no doubt, been sown with the
wheat. They are beautiful to look at, though the
farmer does not enjoy seeing them in his wheat.</p>

<p>Opium is obtained from the juice of the partly
ripened seed pods of some kinds of poppies. Opium is
very valuable as a medicine, but it has to be used with
great care, as it is also a powerful poison.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_064.jpg" alt="poppy" width="300" height="208" />
</div>

<p>A valuable oil is expressed from the seeds of the opium poppy. This
oil is used for illuminating purposes in some parts of the world, and
also for soap-making. The finer quality is used as food, instead of
olive oil, in countries where oil is eaten instead of butter, and it is
also used in grinding artists’ colors.</p>

<p>Linden trees are covered with clusters of white
sweet-scented flowers in the early summer. Each cluster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of flowers is attached in a curious way to a wing,
and often the whole cluster, with its wing, falls together
and is blown to some distance by the wind. When
the lindens are in bloom you will know it by the humming
of the bees, for they are very fond of linden honey,
and the trees often sound like an enormous beehive,
there are so many bees about them.</p>

<p>It would take altogether too long to tell about all the seeds that
are carried by the wind, but you can find a great many of them without
being told; and that, after all, is the best way. At the bottom of this

rather handsome weed, often found in the corners of pastures. You can

<h3><a name="TUMBLEWEEDS" id="TUMBLEWEEDS"></a>TUMBLEWEEDS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Tumbleweeds</span> <em>are</em> funny! They do not fly in the
air, but they go scurrying over the surface of the earth.
They grow on the Western plains
and in other places, and sometimes
get to be as large as a
bushel basket.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_067.jpg" alt="tumble weed" width="200" height="137" />
</div>

<p>They are not very interesting until they begin to tumble. This
happens in the fall of the year.</p>

<p>The plants grow like ordinary little bushes in the
summer and bear a great many clusters of small flowers.
Late in the season the leaves fall off, and the stems of
the plant curl over and make a ball of it. The seeds
do not fall yet; they can be seen in pretty brown clusters
inside the ball.</p>

<p>Along comes a gust of wind; the tumbleweed, all
rolled up and quite dry now, breaks loose from the earth
and away it goes, head over heels, rolling like a wild
thing across the prairies.</p>

<p>It is very funny to see a prairie full of tumbleweeds
racing along. They look as if they were playing tag.
When a train passes, those near the track are caught
in the draught and off they start, head over heels, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>fast as they can. They look exactly as if they were
chasing the train.</p>

<p>The tumbleweed does not send its seed children out
alone into the world; it goes along and spills them over
the prairies, as it tumbles about; for, after a while, the
seeds get thoroughly ripe and fall off. If you were to
see the tumbleweeds rolling about over the prairies in
the fall, you would not wonder there are so many of
them growing everywhere in the summer.</p>

<p>There are several kinds of tumbleweeds in the West.
One of them is called the Russian thistle, though it is
not a thistle. It came from Europe and has proved to
be the very worst weed the farmer has to deal with.</p>

<p>It tumbles about in the fall, rolling far and wide over
the prairies before the high winds. In a few years it
has become such a nuisance that large sums of money
are spent by the government to exterminate it. In
some places the school children have been taught to
recognize it and to pull it up wherever they see it
growing.</p>

<h2><a name="WANDERERS_THAT_CLING" id="WANDERERS_THAT_CLING"></a>WANDERERS THAT CLING</h2>

<h3><a name="BURDOCKS" id="BURDOCKS"></a>BURDOCKS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Seeds</span> have other ways of going about besides being
blown by the wind. One way is to fasten on to anything
or anybody that passes and get carried to some
other place.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_069.jpg" alt="burdocks" width="400" height="286" />
</div>

<p>Burdocks do this. Burdocks grow in dooryards if they get a chance,
and in fence corners and pastures and along roadsides, and in fact
almost anywhere. They are sturdy weeds and often grow quite large. In
“The Ugly Duckling,” Hans Andersen tells us about them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>
<p>“In a sunny spot stood a pleasant old farmhouse, circled all
about with deep canals; and from the walls down to the water’s
edge grew great burdocks, so high that under the tallest of them a
little child might stand upright.”</p>

<p>Like the dandelions and Canada thistles, the burdocks
came from Europe, and a great many people wish they
had stayed at home. That is because of their burrs,
which are a nuisance in the fall of the year.</p>

<p>Everybody knows what burrs are. They stick fast
to the clothes of people and get on the tails and manes
of horses, where they must cause a great deal of discomfort,
and where it is a great deal of work to pick
them out. They get upon the tails of cows, too, and
the fleeces of sheep, and dogs get them on their ears.
The reason is this: the burrs are full of seed pods.
The burdock flower head is, like the dandelion, made
up of a great many tiny flowers, and each flower has a
close-fitting pod containing one seed, or an akene, as we
have learned to call it.</p>

<p>The head of flowers is covered by stiff green bracts,
and at the end of each bract is a hook. These
hooks are soft when the flowers are in blossom,
and they do not catch fast to things. But when
the seeds ripen, the bracts grow hard and stiff,
and so do the hooks at the end.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_070.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="272" />
</div>

<p>Now, when an animal or a person comes along and
brushes against these ripe burrs, the strong hooks catch;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>the burr, full of ripe akenes, is pulled from the plant
and is carried away. It is easy to guess why this
happens.</p>

<p>When one tries to pull a ripe burr from the clothes,
it falls all to pieces and the akenes spill out. Then
each hook has to be pulled out separately, and very
likely each one will prick the fingers.</p>

<p>Children sometimes pick the burrs before they are
ripe, and stick them together to make baskets and other
things. Then the burrs do not fall to pieces nor prick
the fingers much. The burdock has a rank, disagreeable
odor that clings to the fingers a long time after
the burrs have been handled. It is not easy even to
wash it off.</p>

<p>Children often pick ripe burrs and throw them at
each other. Some think this is funny, and some think
it is naughty.</p>

<p>Burdocks yield a valuable medicine; so they are
useful as well as troublesome.</p>

<h3><a name="COCKLEBURS_AND_SAND_SPURS" id="COCKLEBURS_AND_SAND_SPURS"></a>COCKLEBURS AND SAND SPURS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Cockleburs</span> are covered with hooks, too,
but they are much uglier than burdocks, for their seed pods are very
hard and are covered on the outside with stiff, strong hooks that prick
like needles.</p>

<p>When one walks among cockleburs, he soon stops to pick them off, for
they hurt so, he cannot bear it.</p>

<p>Sand spurs are even worse than cockleburs. They are the seed
coverings to a kind of grass.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_072.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="316" />
<p class="captioncenter">Cockleburs.</p>
</div>

<p>In Florida
this grass grows in tufts and spreads out close to the
ground. Some of its stalks are covered with sand
spurs that, like the cockleburs, are hard and are
covered, not with hooks, but with very hard spines.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>These spines stick out in all directions and readily
fasten upon whomever or whatever comes along, when
they leave the parent grass and are carried away.
After a time they are picked off and thrown on the
ground, or they fall off, and that is their way of traveling
to find a place to grow.</p>

<p>Dogs often get them in their feet, and then they have
a hard time picking them out, for of course the poor
things cannot walk with sand spurs between their toes.</p>

<p>There was once a dog that hated sand spurs and loved
people so much that when any one came near him with
sand spurs on his clothes, he would at once begin to
pick them off, and the expression with which he jerked
them out of his mouth showed very plainly what he
thought of sand spurs.</p>

<h3><a name="TICK_TREFOIL" id="TICK_TREFOIL"></a>TICK TREFOIL.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> walking in the woods in the late summer we
sometimes find queer jointed little pods, like unfinished
pea pods, clinging to our clothes.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_074.jpg" alt="tick trefoil" width="250" height="392" />
</div>

<p>These come from plants that belong to the Pea family and are called
Tick Trefoil. There are nearly two dozen kinds of them, and sometimes
they seem to be everywhere in the woods and thickets.</p>

<p>The pods are like pea pods, only that they are jointed, and the
joints break apart, so that each may be carried away separately. Each
joint contains a little pealike seed.</p>

<p>The outside of the pod
seems fuzzy, and it clings very closely to whatever it
touches. If we look at the fuzz with a magnifying glass,
we shall find it made up of innumerable little hooks.</p>

<p>The hairs that cover the pod are turned up at
the end to form little hooks, very delicate, but able,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>when there are so many of them, to hold on very
tightly.</p>

<p>They seem to snuggle down into the cloth they touch,
so that it is difficult to pick them off, and the joints all
separate when we try to remove them, so that each one
has to be taken off separately.</p>

<p>Another plant whose seed pods are covered with
hooked hairs is the sweet-scented bedstraw. This is
a pretty little plant that spreads about on the ground.
Its flowers are small and greenish, but the whole plant
when in bloom has a pretty lace-like effect as we find
it in the woods very often growing about fallen logs.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_075.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="129" />
<p class="captioncenter">Sweet-scented bedstraw.</p>
</div>

<p>Its seed pods are small and, like the tick trefoil, are
covered with hairs that, under the magnifying glass, are
seen to be hooked.</p>

<p>The enchanter’s nightshade is another little plant
whose seed pods are covered with hooked hair. It is as
pretty as its name and is to be found in damp woods.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>
<p>There is a tall leafy kind that grows sometimes two
feet high and is topped with numerous branches of small
white flowers. As the flower stem lengthens, the flowers
continue to unfold at the tip, while lower down are the
many little seed pods, shaped like little tennis racquets.</p>

<p>The prettiest enchanter’s nightshade, however, is a
little fairy that sometimes grows on decaying logs. It
is often not more than three or four inches high and
ends in a branch of pretty little white flowers with
bright red calyx lobes. After these dainty blossoms
come the little hook-haired, racquet-shaped seed pods.</p>

<p>Look for enchanter’s nightshade the next time you
go to the woods in the summer time. Below is a picture
of the large one.</p>

<h3><a name="STICK-TIGHTS" id="STICK-TIGHTS"></a>STICK-TIGHTS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Stick-tights</span> are troublesome to us, and we call them
very disagreeable names, such as beggar ticks and beggar
lice. But they are really not bad at all and are
quite pretty. If they stick to us, that is our fault quite
as much as theirs, for we should keep away from them
if we are unwilling to carry them about.</p>

<p>They cling to whatever comes along, because that is
their way of traveling about. They cannot walk or
creep or crawl or jump; neither can they fly very far
nor move in any other way, excepting as they are
carried.</p>

<p>You know how they look&mdash;so <img class="vm"
src="images/i_077a.jpg" alt="" width="30" height="50" /> Of course
this little brown, flat object with horns is an akene. Inside it is a
seed. The two horns at the top are able to fasten it quite tightly to a
woolen dress or a sheep’s fleece. If you look carefully, you will
see little hard teeth on the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74"
id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>edge of the stick-tight that help it to
cling. On one species of stick-tight these teeth point backward, like
the barbs of a fishhook, and that kind sticks very tightly.</p>

<div class="figright2">
<img src="images/i_077b.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="180" />
<p class="captioncenter">Stick-tight plant.</p>
</div>

<p>Stick-tight plants blossom in the summer time. The
greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in heads like the
dandelion flowers, and like those each stick-tight flower
has an akene at the bottom. These akenes grow much
larger than those of the dandelion, and they have the
two horns on their heads.</p>

<p>The akenes stand on a flat cushion, just as the dandelion
akenes do, but these do not wait for the wind to
blow them away, though, if nothing comes along to pull
them loose, they in time become very dry and fall out,
and then the wind often carries the light little things
some distance.</p>

<p>But their favorite method of traveling is by stagecoach,
and if you happen along at the right time they
will take you for their stagecoach, and let you carry
them to a new place. Sometimes the plants grow so
closely together that in passing through them one
becomes quite covered with the little brown things, and
it is a long and tiresome task to pick them out.</p>

<p>They, too, get on the tails and manes of horses, and
the tails of cows, the coats of dogs, and the fleeces of
sheep; but they are not nearly as troublesome to these
creatures as are the burdocks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>
<p>There are several species of stick-tights, or beggar
ticks, as they are more generally called.</p>

<p>Some have rather large flower heads, with the outer
flowers each provided with a long, broad yellow petal.
These are often called wild sunflowers, because they look
something like a little sunflower.</p>

<p>There is a plant called Spanish needles, very closely
related to the stick-tights, and that has four horns to
its seed pod.</p>

<p>The burr marigold, which grows in wet places, and
whose greenish flower heads are round like a marble, is
also related to the stick-tights, and, like the Spanish
needles, has four horns.</p>

<p>A great many plants have these little horned seed
cases, and when you go about the country in the fall of
the year you will be certain to make the acquaintance
of some of them. The plants with horned seed pods
wish their seeds to get out of the dense thickets in
which they usually grow, and they do what they can to
help them.</p>

<h3><a name="AGRIMONY_AND_OTHER_WEEDS" id="AGRIMONY_AND_OTHER_WEEDS"></a>AGRIMONY AND OTHER WEEDS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the fall of the year and towards the end
of summer we find a great many weeds in the
woods and along the roads, sending their seeds out
into the world by means of stout hooks, or else
hooked hairs or sharp spines.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_080.jpg" alt="agrimony" width="150" height="300" />
</div>

<p>The agrimony is one of these. It is a common, rather pretty plant
with yellow flowers, and it has a burr or seed pod, armed with hooked
prickles around the waist, so to speak.</p>

<p>After a walk in the country through woods and fields, in the autumn,
one will be likely to find a number of little things clinging to
one’s clothes. Instead of merely shaking or picking them off and
throwing them away, carefully collect them, and when there is time look
at them.</p>

<p>You will very likely find yourself decorated with a number of
different kinds of seeds or seed pods, that vainly hoped in you to find
a means of traveling to new and better places of growth.</p> <p><span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<p>All these little brown things are disappointed, or would be if they
could feel disappointed. But you can profit by their misfortune, and,
by carefully examining the little wanderers, can learn a great many
interesting and wonderful truths about the plant world in its effort to
scatter its seeds.</p>

<h3><a name="FLAX" id="FLAX"></a>FLAX.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> flax is a very useful plant, for the fibers of its
stems are long and strong, and are spun into thread and
then woven into linen.</p>

<p>Besides this, the seeds are useful.
They contain an oil which is pressed
out and is known as linseed oil. It is
used a great deal by painters in mixing
their paints.</p>

<p>When flaxseeds are wet they become
very sticky on the outside. A jelly-like
substance covers them, and this it is
which we drink in “flaxseed tea” to
cure our colds.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_082.jpg" alt="" width="127" height="350" />
<p class="captioncenter">Flax.</p>
</div>

<p>You can easily see this jelly-like covering by putting a few
flaxseeds in a few drops of water and leaving them there a little
while.</p>

<p>You can readily see that when the
flaxseeds are shed in the field and are met by the rain,
they would stick to the feathers, feet, and beaks of
birds that came to eat the seeds. If the birds flew
to another place, as they often would, to clean their
plumage, they would rub off the flaxseeds, that mean-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>time
had become dry again, and often the seeds would
drop off, as the bird moved about. In this way they
would get planted in new places. No doubt the sticky
covering to the wet seed also helps to anchor it to the
ground and keep it from blowing away when once it
has settled down on the earth.</p>

<p>The flax plant that we find so useful is not wild. It
is carefully cultivated in many parts of the world and
has been cultivated for so long a time, and in so many
places, that nobody knows where it first came from.
It is a pretty plant, that bears bright blue flowers.</p>

<p>Why do you not buy a penny’s worth of flaxseeds
at the drug store and plant them in your garden and
become acquainted with this very interesting and beautiful
little plant?</p>

<h3><a name="MISTLETOE" id="MISTLETOE"></a>MISTLETOE.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> mistletoe grows on trees. It has no roots of its
own, but attaches itself to the bark of the tree and
sucks out the sap.</p>

<p>Since it lives up in trees, its seeds must be able to find
lodgment in these high places; and this the birds help
them to do. The mistletoe has light green leaves; it
grows in bunches and bears white berries.</p>

<p>The seeds in the berries are covered by a viscid substance,
and when the birds eat the berries, some of these
seeds will be apt to cling to them and be left on the
branches of some other tree.</p>

<p>If the seeds happen to get swallowed, that does not
hurt them, for they are not digested, but are passed
out just as they were swallowed, and they then often
fall upon the tree branches, where they can grow.</p>

<p>The English mistletoe very often grows upon the
oak tree, and from very early times the plant was
rev<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>erenced by the people, and particularly by the Druids,
who used it in their religious observances. A survival
of this old superstition about the mistletoe is found in
its use to-day at Christmas time.</p>

<h3><a name="OTHER_PLANTS_WITH_STICKY_SEEDS_OR_SEED_PODS" id="OTHER_PLANTS_WITH_STICKY_SEEDS_OR_SEED_PODS"></a>OTHER PLANTS WITH STICKY SEEDS OR SEED PODS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Quite</span> a number of plants prepare sticky coverings to
their seeds or seed pods, in order to help the seeds
get away.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_086.jpg" alt="squirting cucumber" width="215" height="300" />
</div>


<p>The squirting cucumber is one of the most curious of these. It grows
wild in southern Europe, but is sometimes seen in gardens in this
country, not because of its beauty, but because it is so curious. It is
a hairy plant and not at all pretty, but when its hairy cucumber-shaped
seed pods are ripe something funny happens. The pod falls from the
vine, and through the round hole left when it fell away from its stem,
that which is inside the pod is shot out with violence. Out fly seeds
and a quantity of sticky liquid. If a bird happens to be about when
this happens, he will make haste to get far from such a queer-acting
plant; and if he was shot by it, he will carry some of the sticky seeds
with him; or he may get the seeds attached to him after they have been
shot out.</p>

<p>You see the squirting cucumber has two ways of
sending its seeds on their journey into the world. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>shoots them some distance at the start and also provides
them with a sticky covering, so that they may have a
chance to get carried still farther.</p>

<p>Some plants have sticky hairs growing to their seed
pods. We know that a good many plants have their
pods covered with hairs which are hooked at the ends.
Well, some are covered with hairs that have a drop of
viscid substance at the tip, instead of a hook; these
hairs fasten on quite as firmly as if they were hooked.</p>

<p>The pretty little twin flower, or ground vine, as it is
sometimes called, has a pair of scales growing about its
seed pod, and these scales are covered with sticky hairs.</p>

<p>The soft little mouse-ear chickweed, that grows everywhere in waste
places, has several species which are covered all over with fine hairs
which have a sticky tip. When the plant withers, it is easily pulled
from the ground, and as it remains sticky, even after withering, the
whole plant is often carried away by passing animals or people, and its
seeds shed in some distant place.</p>

<p>See if you can find some plants that have their seeds carried
because some part of the plant is sticky. There are not a great many of
them; still, if you look long enough, you will be sure to find some.</p>

<h2><a name="WANDERERS_THAT_FLOAT" id="WANDERERS_THAT_FLOAT"></a>WANDERERS THAT FLOAT.</h2>

<p>Some kinds of plants live in the water or on the edge of it. These
often have seeds or seed pods light enough to float. You can generally
see little seeds floating about on ponds, if you take the trouble to
look.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_088.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" />
<p class="captioncenter">Cocoanut palms.</p>
</div>

<p>Into these ponds come ducks or herons or other waterfowl. The birds
come to find something to eat, and as they swim or wade about they come
in contact with the wet seeds that cling to them. After a time the
birds, bearing the seeds on plumage, beak, or feet, fly to another pond
or marsh, and as they alight the seeds are floated off.</p>

<p>The wind then blows them to the shore, or else in
time, if they live in the water, they sink to the bottom
and sprout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The cocoanut is a seed that is surrounded by a strong
shell and a thick coat of fiber that protects it from the
water and also makes it light.</p>

<p>The nut inside this thick overcoat is hollow when
ripe, excepting for a watery liquid that we call the milk
of the cocoanut. As we see cocoanuts in stores, the
outer coat has been taken off.</p>

<p>Cocoanuts grow near the tops of tall cocoanut palms,
and these palms are fond of standing on the seashore.
When the nuts get ripe they often fall in the sea and
are carried long distances by the ocean currents. In
this way, no doubt, many a coral island has received its
lovely fringe of cocoanut palms.</p>

<p>The nuts are floated to these little islands and washed
into crevices on them, where they lodge and in time
grow into stately trees.</p>

<p>The cocoanut palm is a very important tree in tropical
countries. The nuts are used as food, and a valuable
oil is obtained from them. Cocoa oil is used for illuminating
and also for making salves.</p>

<p>The thick fiber that surrounds the nut is strong and
tough and is made into cloth, matting, brushes, baskets,
coarse rope, and a number of things. Matting is used
in some hot countries to make the sides of houses, and
the cocoanut fiber is useful to thatch roofs.</p>

<p>The wood of the tree is hard and durable and is made
into many household articles. The hard shell of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>nut makes good cups and dishes. So you see the cocoanut
tree affords almost everything the people in the hot
countries need.</p>

<p>They make their houses and furnish them from it,
they get food and drink from it, for the milk of the
cocoanut is a very pleasant beverage, and they use
the oil to light their abodes at night. No wonder the
people value this noble tree very highly.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_HICKORY" id="THE_HICKORY"></a>THE HICKORY.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> meat of the hickory nut is a seed.
The hickory tree bears two kinds of blossoms. Like the willow, it has
staminate catkins and also bears pistillate flowers, from which grow
nuts. Some hickory catkins are very long and slender and make pretty
green tassels on the trees in the spring. Hickory nuts are good to eat,
and you may wonder how these delicious nuts, that many creatures are
fond of, ever get a chance to grow.</p>

<p>Squirrels are fond of nuts, and they are generally on hand when the
nuts are ripe.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_091b.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="155" />
<p class="captioncenter">Young<br />
hickory nuts.</p>
</div>

<p>The green nuts have
an outer covering that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>splits open when the nut is ripe and lets it fall to
the ground. Of course when a squirrel has eaten
a nut, that is the end of it. But squirrels are good
housekeepers and store away nuts in holes in the
trees or in the ground. Chipmunks do the same,
and some birds, as nutcrackers and blue jays, hide
nuts in the same way. Often these nuts are forgotten,
or else the little creature that hid them may die or
be killed. Then the nuts that have been put in the
ground have nothing to do but grow when spring
warms the earth.</p>

<p>You see they have been planted by the little nut
lovers, that certainly had no intention of planting
them. No doubt a great many nut trees get started
in this way.</p>

<p>Hickory nuts are often called “walnuts” in New
England. The hickory tree belongs to North America,
and before this continent was discovered only the
Indians enjoyed hickory nuts. Now they are sent to
England, and indeed all over the world.</p>

<p>The wood of the hickory is hard, tough, and flexible
and is very valuable.</p>

<p>Andrew Jackson was called “Old Hickory” because
of his unyielding nature, and when you study the history
of the United States, or read the life of Jackson,
you will not wonder that he was so named.</p>

<p>Hickory switches were used long ago when children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>were naughty; they were preferred to willow, because
they did not break so easily.</p>

<p>A better use to put hickory to is to burn it. Hickory
logs make a very hot and beautiful fire, and hickory is
one of the best of woods to burn in fireplaces.</p>

<h3><a name="WALNUTS_AND_BUTTERNUTS" id="WALNUTS_AND_BUTTERNUTS"></a>WALNUTS AND BUTTERNUTS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Black</span> walnuts grow on large, handsome
trees of very hard, fragrant, dark-colored wood. Walnut wood used to
be prized more highly than it is to-day for furniture and the inside
finish to houses. It takes a fine polish but grows rather dark and
somber-looking with age.</p>

<p>The black walnut is a native of the eastern part of North America.
It belongs to the same family as the hickory and, like that, bears two
kinds of flowers.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_094.jpg" alt="" width="178" height="300" />
<p class="captioncenter">Ripe walnuts.</p>
</div>

<p>The nuts have hard, thick, black shells, and also a softer outer
covering, or rind, that is very bitter and disagreeable to the taste,
and that stains the fingers a dark brown.</p>

<p>The “meat,” or kernel, of the walnut is very oily, and
some people do not like it because of its rather strong
flavor. Squirrels are fond of walnuts, however, and
often plant them in the way we have seen.</p>

<p>The English walnut is an Asiatic tree belonging to
the same family, which has been cultivated in Europe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>and, to a small extent, in this country. Its nut is
larger than the black walnut, has a thin shell and a
large, sweet kernel. The nut is delicious and a great
favorite at Christmas time. It is sometimes picked
green and pickled, and some people are very fond of
pickled walnuts.</p>

<p>The nut yields an abundance of valuable oil, and the
wood of the tree is very beautiful and useful for many
purposes, one of which is to finish houses on the inside,
and another to make gunstocks.</p>

<p>There is another tree belonging to the same family
that grows in America and looks very much like the
black walnut tree. It is the butternut. Butternut
wood is valuable, and butternuts have sweet, oily kernels
that most people like. The flowers, of course, are
like those of the walnut.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_095.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="140" />
<p class="captioncenter">Butternuts.</p>

<p>A brown dye is made from the inner bark of the
butternut tree, and also a medicine is obtained from it.</p>

<p>During the War of the Rebellion the Southern soldiers were often
dressed in homespun clothes dyed by the bark of the butternut, and on
this account they were called “butternuts.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> chestnut is a very large and
beautiful tree that grows abundantly in some parts of New England and
over the Alleghany Mountains. Children always know the chestnut trees,
if they live near them.</p>

<p>Like the hickory and walnut, the chestnut has its staminate flowers
in catkins, but these are white instead of green, and give the chestnut
a very handsome appearance when they cover it with airy plumes in the
early summer.</p>

<p>The nuts grow in prickly burrs, two or three in a burr. When the
nuts are ripe in the fall, the burrs open to let them out. As everybody
knows, they have a thin shell and a sweet kernel. They are sometimes
boiled and sometimes eaten raw.</p>

<p>Squirrels, chipmunks, and some birds are fond of
them and are often the means of planting them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>
<p>Chestnut wood is soft and has rather a coarse, loose
grain. It is used largely for fence rails, cheap shingles,
and railroad ties.</p>

<p>Chestnuts grow in some parts of Europe and Asia,
and there is one kind that bears a nut as large as a
black walnut. This nut is not as sweet as our chestnuts,
but it is extensively used as food in some parts of
Europe. The people go in families to gather the nuts,
and prize them as we prize wheat and corn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are other nuts, as the pecan, whose
tree belongs to the Hickory family and grows wild in the southern part
of the United States; the beechnut, which grows on a stately tree of
our forests; and the hazelnut, that grows on bushes in thickets near
streams sometimes, or on the borders of woods.</p>

<p>But squirrels, chipmunks, birds, and such folk are not the only ones
that plant seeds. Some ants do. Indeed ants are great hands to plant
seeds. They do not take the hard nuts, but rather the seeds of certain
grasses and other plants that bear rather small seeds. The ants carry
the seeds into their holes, where they sometimes eat only one part of
the seed, not enough to hurt it in the least, and so the seeds, buried
in the ant-hills, are able to grow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>
<p>Ants often drop the seeds they are carrying and lose
them, and so the road to the home of the seed-eating
ants is often grown over by plants the ants have sown.</p>

<h3><a name="BERRIES" id="BERRIES"></a>BERRIES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> berries, such as raspberries and strawberries,
are so good they seem to grow on purpose to be eaten.
Very likely they do.</p>

<p>It is quite necessary for the blackberry and raspberry
bushes to have their seeds sown at some distance from
the parent plants, and it is also an advantage to strawberries
to have their seeds dispersed. So what is better
than to get the help of the birds?</p>

<p>To this end the berries are sweet and juicy when ripe,
and they are bright in color, so that the birds can easily
find them. A bird often picks a berry and carries it
somewhere else to eat, and often it eats only a part and
leaves the rest, which falls to the
ground.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_100.jpg" alt="berries" width="400" height="226" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>
<p>All berries have seeds in them or outside of them.
Strawberries have the little seeds on the outside, as
you can easily see.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_101.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" />
<p class="captioncenter">Bunchberries.</p>
</div>

<p>Gooseberries, currants, and grapes have the little
seeds inside, but, whichever way it is, some of the seeds
will be left or scattered about by the birds that eat the
berries. If some of the seeds are swallowed, that does
not seem to hurt them; like the mistletoe seeds, they
are able to sprout after having been eaten by a bird.</p>

<p>Birds eat a great many kinds of berries that we never think of
eating. Notice how often in the late summer and the autumn you will see
bright red or blue, or black, or white berries shining out from the
leaves or bare branches of the wayside hedges. All of these are eaten
by birds and carried away to new growing places.</p>

<p>Not all birds eat berries or seeds. Watch the birds and see if you
can find out which kinds eat berries and seeds.</p>

<h3><a name="CHERRIES" id="CHERRIES"></a>CHERRIES.</h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no need of describing
cherries, as everybody knows them
well.</p>

<p>The birds are so fond of ripe cherries that we sometimes have
difficulty in getting our share before the robins and thrushes have
taken all. Birds frequently fly away with the cherries, eat the pulp,
and drop the stone, which, of course, contains a seed, and this seed
then often sprouts and grows into a cherry tree. We sometimes find good
cherries growing in hedges and thickets, far from the orchard; these
have been planted there by the birds.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_102b.jpg" alt="cherries" width="249" height="300" />
</div>

<p>The sweet cherry is not a native
of this country, but was brought
here from Europe. We have a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>number of wild cherries, however, whose fruit we do
not esteem, but the birds are fond of it, and they are
the means of planting a good many wild cherry trees
over the country.</p>

<p>Plums, peaches, and apricots are delicious fruits with
hard-shelled seeds. The fruit is gathered, the pulp
eaten, and the stone thrown away. We do not eat the
seed of the plum, peach, and cherry, as we do that of
the hickory and butternut. We throw it away, and
thus disperse the seed children of these fruit trees.</p>

<p>The birds spread the seeds of the wild plums as they
do those of the cherries. The kernels of all these seeds
are bitter and contain a very poisonous substance.</p>

<p>Cherry trees have beautiful white blossoms that
come early in the spring, and the peach trees have
lovely pink blossoms. The peaches bloom the earliest
of all, and as their flowers come out before the
leaves, they turn the world into a maze of pink
beauty in the parts where the peach orchards
are.</p>

<h3><a name="APPLES" id="APPLES"></a>APPLES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Apples</span> have tough cores in which their somewhat
delicate seeds are protected. When we eat apples we
throw the cores away. We now
know that this is just what the
apple wants.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_104a.jpg" alt="apple flower" width="300" height="247" />
</div>

<p>If the core is tossed into a hedge by the roadside, its seeds may
get a chance to sprout, and indeed they often do, for in the country we
often come upon apple trees in out-of-the-way corners, where they were
not planted by man on purpose.</p>

<p>Apples do not grow wild in this country, excepting crab apples. No
doubt the birds carry away the ripe crab apples and drop the cores.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_104b.jpg" alt="apple" width="197" height="220" />
</div>

<p>Pears and quinces have cores like the
apples, and they are not natives of this
country, but were brought here because
of their delicious fruit. Sometimes we find them growing
wild, and we know how this happened.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>
<p>The next time we get a chance let us look for the
fruit trees the birds have planted. There are a good
many wild fruits that the birds are fond of, and whose
seeds they are in the habit of dispersing over broad
sections of country.</p>

<h3><a name="OXALIS" id="OXALIS"></a>OXALIS.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> plants have a way of shooting their seeds out
of the pods. You know about the squirting cucumber.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_106.jpg" alt="" width="99" height="250" />
<p class="captioncenter">Oxalis.</p>
</div>

<p>The little “sheep-sorrel,” or yellow-flowered
oxalis, that grows everywhere
in the fields and gardens, has a way of
shooting off its seeds when they are
ripe.</p>

<p>There is an elastic covering over each
seed, and when the pod opens, this covering
splits and suddenly curls up, with
force enough to send the seed quite a
distance.</p>

<p>The leaves of the oxalis are sour, and
children sometimes eat them.</p>

<p>A very powerful poison can be extracted from them,
which is called oxalic acid, and sometimes salt of lemons,
but there is not enough of this poison in the leaves to
make them harmful to eat. The poison when obtained
in large quantities is useful in the manufacture of calico,
where it is used in printing the colors, and it is also
sometimes used in a diluted form to clean metal work.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>
<p>Be sure to look for the seed pods of the oxalis; they
stand up like little candles and are very pretty. Gather
some that are almost ripe and see how they shoot their
seeds.</p>

<h3><a name="WITCH-HAZEL" id="WITCH-HAZEL"></a>WITCH-HAZEL.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> little tree blossoms in the fall of
the year. After the leaves are gone, and sometimes after the snow has
come, it stands in the edge of the woods dressed in a fairy costume of
yellow lace-like flowers. After the flowers come the pods. They are
very hard and horny and do not ripen until the next fall.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_108a.jpg" alt="witch-hazel" width="116" height="300" />
</div>

<p>It is fun to gather ripe witch-hazel pods, for when they have been
in the house a little while and have become thoroughly dry they “go
off.”</p>

<p>You may be sitting by the table reading, when
pop!&mdash;a hard, shining little black seed strikes you in
the face. It is the witch-hazel beginning its cannonade.
Pop!&mdash;spat!&mdash;crack!&mdash;the battery has opened, and
the seeds are flying with great force <span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>in all directions. They
are sometimes shot several yards.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_108b.jpg" alt="" width="118" height="200" />
</div>

<p>Of course in the woods this shooting is intended to
start the seed children on their journey in the world.</p>

<p>The witch-hazel pod bursts open, and the edges turn
in and press against the smooth seeds with great force,
so that when they leave the pod they fly as though shot
out of a sling. Get some witch-hazel pods and see how
they do it.</p>

<p>Another name for witch-hazel is hamamelis, and from
the bark is made a medicine which is put upon bruises.
A forked twig of witch-hazel is sometimes used as a
divining rod to find where to dig for water, or for gold
or silver or other metals. The rod is held in the fingers
of the diviner, who walks about, and wherever the rod
turns and points down it is supposed to be the place to dig.</p>

<p>Divining rods are not much used in these days. People
are not as superstitious, in some ways, as they used
to be, and they know the rod cannot help them.</p>

<h3><a name="TOUCH-ME-NOT" id="TOUCH-ME-NOT"></a>TOUCH-ME-NOT.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> touch-me-not, or snap-weed, is a
delicate little plant that grows in wet places. Its yellow flowers are
airily poised on slender stems, and the seed pods are very curious.</p>

<p>If one of them is touched, it goes off with a suddenness that is
startling, until one gets used to it.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_110.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="332" />
<p class="captioncenter"> A pod that<br />
has snapped.</p>
</div>

<p>When the pods are ripe they shoot the seeds out in all directions,
and if you disturb a tangle of touch-me-nots in late summer you can
hear the seeds popping on all sides.</p>

<p>There is a violet that shoots the seeds out of its pod,
and the wild geranium pod slings its seeds to some distance
by suddenly curling up on its long stalk.</p>

<p>A good many seed pods have this interesting habit,
but I doubt if you would discover that some peas and
beans do this unless you were told.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>
<p>The lupine, which belongs to the Pea family, shoots
off its seeds by twisting the dry pod, as it opens to let
them out. Even our garden sweet peas and some of
our garden beans do this. Watch to see if you can
catch them at it.</p>

<p>Plants have many, many ways of sending their
precious seed children out in the world to find a growing
place.</p>

<p>There is no better way to spend our spare time than
to watch the ripe fruits of plants and find out how the
seeds are dispersed. Nearly all plants have some
methods of sending their seeds abroad.</p>

<p>You will enjoy the plants more than ever when you
begin to discover for yourself some of the things
they do.</p>
